  /// To use method swizzling with your Swift classes there are two requirements that you must comply with:
  /// 1. The class containing the methods to be swizzled must extend **NSObject**.
  /// 1. The methods you want to swizzle must have the **dynamic** attribute.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - originalSelector: `Selector` for the original method
  ///   - swizzledSelector: `Selector` for the swizzled methos
  ///
  /// - Note: In Objective-C you'd perform the swizzling in load() , but this method is not permitted in Swift.
  /// But load is a Objective-C only method and cannot be overridden in Swift, trying to do it anyway will result in a compile time error.
  /// The next best place to perform the swizzling is in initialize, a method called right before the first method of your class is invoked.
